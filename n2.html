            Kadokawa announced on Monday that Nami Sano's Migi to Dali manga is inspiring an <br>anime. Kadokawa did not reveal any further details on the anime. Sano drew the below <br>illustration to celebrate the announcement.<br><br>
 
The manga launched in the 46th issue of Kadokawa's harta magazine in July 2017. The <br>magazine describes the story:<br><br>
Under the table is the angel's secret.<br><br>
The boy's name was Hitori. A stork brought the angel into the lives of a <br>middle-aged couple who were <br>not blessed with children. His parents were kind, his house spacious, and his meals hot. But to protect the happiness he <br>had received, Hitori continued to hide an important secret from his parents.<br><br>
The manga recently ended on November 15, with its seventh and final volume slated to <br>ship on Wednesday.<br><br>
Haven't You Heard? I'm Sakamoto was Sano's debut series. <br>Sano launched the series in harta in 2011, and ended the series in December 2015. Seven Seas Entertainment <br>publishes the manga in North America, and the company released the fourth and final <br>volume in July 2016.<br><br>
The Haven't You Heard? I'm Sakamoto manga inspired a television anime that <br>premiered in April 2016. Crunchyroll streamed the series as it aired in Japan. Sentai <br>Filmworks has licensed the series.<br><br>
Update: Introduction fixed. Thanks, Shay Guy.<br>
