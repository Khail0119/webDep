            <blockquote>
                The official Twitter account for Kadokawa's Dengeki Bunko label revealed on Saturday <br>that Asato Asato's 86 light novel series is getting its first spinoff novel. The novel will <br>serialize on Dengeki Bunko's Novecomi app starting in spring 2022.<br><br>
                The novel will take place in the Federal Republic of Giad, and will feature new <br>characters, weapons, and battlefields. SOW (The Combat Baker and Automaton <br>Waitress) is writing the novel, and Kuroganeya is the illustrator. Asato is credited <br>with the original work, Shirabi is credited with the original illustrations, and I-IV is <br>credited with the mechanical design.<br><br>
                Yen Press is publishing the main light novel series in English, and it describes the story:<br><br>
                The San Magnolia Republic has long been under attack by unmanned <br>weapons from the neighboring Empire. Against this onslaught, the Republic <br>has also deployed similar weapons, narrowly avoiding great loss of life and <br>impending disaster-or at least that's how it seemed.<br><br>
                The truth is that it has never been possible to have no casualties. Young <br>men and women drawn from the Republic's supposedly non-existent 86th <br>district are organized into the "86 unit" and then ordered to pilot the<br> "unmanned weapons" before heading to battle.<br><br>
                Asato launched the novel series under Kadokawa's Dengeki Bunko imprint in April <br>2017. Shirabi (The Ryuo's Work Is Never Done!, Myriad Colors Phantom World) is <br>drawing the illustrations, and the artist I-IV (Aldnoah.Zero, Re:CREATORS) is in charge <br>of mechanical design. The 10th volume shipped on June 10, and the 11th volume will <br>ship in February 2022. <br><br>Motoki Yoshihara launched a manga adaptation in Square Enix's <br>Young Gangan magazine in 2018. Yen Press is also releasing the manga in English.<br><br>
                Suzume Somemiya's 86: Operation High School spinoff manga launched in Kadokawa's <br>Monthly Comic Alive magazine in June 2020, and the series ended in August. The <br>manga has two volumes. cotori is drawing a four-panel manga spinoff that launched in <br>July on the anime's Twitter account and website.<br><br>
                The television anime premiered on April 10, and is airing for two cours (quarters of the year). <br>The second cours premiered on October 2. Crunchyroll is streaming the series as <br>it airs in Japan, and it is also streaming an English dub.<br><br>
