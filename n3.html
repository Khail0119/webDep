            Crunchyroll began streaming the first volume of The Ancient Magus' Bride -The Boy <br>from the West and the Knight of the Blue Storm original anime disc (OAD) on Friday.<br><br>
            Crunchyroll describes the OAD:<br><br>
            Just prior to Chise becoming a part-time student, during Cartaphilus' brief <br>nap… Chise receives an invitation to the academy, and she, with the help of <br>Elias and the others, begins preparing. One such busy day, a spriggan <br>arrives at their home on a strange horse, bringing news that "something is <br>wrong with this Wild Hunt." Gabriel, an ordinary boy who'd just moved from <br>London, was bored. Of his situation, of being parted from his friends, of <br>unfamiliar land. Of everything. He was staring through his window, as if to <br>escape from it all, when he caught a glimpse of tobacco smoke. When he <br>ran outside to chase it, the impossible happened: his world began to <br>intertwine with the veiled world of the mages.<br><br>
            Crunchyroll is streaming the project worldwide outside of Asia.<br><br>
            The three-episode OAD project is being bundled with the limited editions of the 16th,<br>17th, and 18th volumes of Kore Yamazaki's The Ancient Magus' Bride manga. The 16th <br>volume shipped on September 10. The 17th volume will ship on March 10, 2022, and <br>the 18th volume will ship on September 10, 2022.<br><br>
            The staff describes the OAD series as the "first part" of the new anime project.<br><br>
            Yamazaki herself pens the story of the series.<br><br>
            Kazuaki Terasawa (Anonymous Noise episode director) is directing the anime at Studio <br>Kafka, a new animation studio established specifically for the OAD project. Aya Takaha <br>returns from the television anime to pen the script alongside Yoko Yonaiyama (Uma <br>Musume Pretty Derby episode scriptwriter). Hirotaka Katō returns as character designer <br>from the previous anime, and Junichi Matsumoto also returns to compose the music.<br><br>
