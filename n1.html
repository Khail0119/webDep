<blockquote>Aniplus-Asia began streaming an English-subtitled promotional video on Monday for its <br>simulcast of CloverWorks' new original television anime series Tokyo Twenty Fourth <br>Ward (Tokyo 24-ku). The simulcast will air in January.<br><br>
    The anime will premiere on January 5 with a one-hour special.<br><br>
    Naokatsu Tsuda (director of first four JoJo's Bizarre Adventure anime seasons, chief <br>director of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Golden Wind) is directing the anime at <br>CloverWorks. Vio Shimokura of Nitroplus is writing and overseeing the series scripts. <br>FiFS (made up of Shuji Sogabe and Kanako Nono) is designing the characters, and <br>Takahiro Kishida (Baccano!, Durarara!!, Haikyu!!) is adapting those designs for <br>animation. Hideyuki Fukasawa (Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works, Flowers of Evil) <br>is composing the music. Rock band Survive Said the Prophet will perform the opening <br>theme song "Paper Sky," while voice actors Junya Enoki, Yūma Uchida, and Kaito <br>Ishikawa will perform the ending theme song "255,255,255."<br><br>
    The anime takes place on an artificial island floating in Tokyo Bay, named "Kyokutō <br>Hōreigai Tokubetsu Chiku" (Far East Special District Outside of the Law), nicknamed <br>"24th Ward." The manga centers on three childhood friends born and raised on the island: Ran, Koki, and Shuta. <br>The three have different social standings, hobbies, <br>and personalities, but they are always hanging out together. But their relationships will <br>change dramatically after a certain incident.<br><br>
    At a memorial ceremony one year after the incident, the three happen to meet again, <br>and all of their phones start to ring at once. The phone call is from a friend they thought <br>was dead, urging them to "choose the future." Each young man will believe in their own <br>way of doing things to protect the future of the people of the 24th Ward.<br><br>
